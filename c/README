base92
================================================================================
A little library for encoding byte-strings into strings easily
typeable on a standard US 101-key keyboard.


USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    #include <base92/base92.h>
    ...
    strcmp(base92encode("hello world", 11), "Fc_$aOTdKnsM*k") == 0;
    base92decode("Fc_$aOTdKnsM*k", &length);
    length == 11;
    ...


DESIGN DECISIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For wider design decisions, see the README for the wider base92
package: https://raw.github.com/thenoviceoof/base92/master/README.md

The library is somewhat optimized for speed, with a static table
sitting at the heart of the encode/decode routines. However, it has
not been profiled and optimized in the traditional sense.

The strings output by base92encode are null-delimited, while
base92decode gives a non-null-delimited string, since such a string
could be binary in nature and it wouldn't make sense to null-delimit
such a string.
